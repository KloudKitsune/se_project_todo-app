# Simple Todo App

This is a task app with options for setting a task as well as a date, deleting that task, or marking the task as completed.

## Functionality

Here is a task app that has the following functions. Create a task as well as set a due date for that task, mark and unmark the task as completed and delete the task.
I have refactored the validation rules from the validate.js file to a FormValidator.js for it to comply with ES6 Features. Using Class syntax instead of function constructors and import/export statement instead of script tags.
Also added unique IDs to new to-do items from importing from a CDN into the index.js file since there isnt a database that we are pulling data from at the moment.

## Technology

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript => which was the focus.

the main point of this project is to showcase more modern methods for javascript concepts.
